            Rhea speaks about herself in the 3rd person for the purposes of this website.
            She likes dogs and memes. Also cats. She likes spiritual yogic stuff, healthy food and
            wishes snow would happen during summer. She likes the sea and loves the mountains.
            She hated the movie <strong>IT</strong> and has seen Friends many times. She signed the petition to redo the final
            season of Game of Thrones. She always chooses Sonic when playing
            Super Smash Bros and used to listen to gangsta rap on the way to her former job
            at a Consulate in Rome.
